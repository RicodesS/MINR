$L_e$ = $\sum_{h \in H_e}x_e$$_h$ $\forall$ e$\in$E\\ 
L = max$_e$$_\in$$_E$$L_e$\\
\textbf{ILP Formulation:}\\
min L\\
s.t.\\
1. $x_e$$_h$ $\in$ $\{$0,1$\}$ $\forall$ e$\in$E,$\forall$ h$\in$H$_e$\Comment{x=1 if elf e visits house h, 0 otherwise}\\
2. $x_e$$_h$ = 0 $\forall$ e$\in$E, $\forall$ h $\notin$ $H_e$\Comment{x=0 if elf e is not able to visit house h}\\
3. $\sum_{h}x_e$$_h$ $\leq$ L $\forall$ e$\in$E\Comment{Sum of all houses visited by an elf isn't greater than makespan}\\
4. $|$$\bigcup_{e \in E}$ $\bigcup_{h \in H_e}$ $x_e$$_h$$|$ = $|$H$|$, $x_e$$_h$ = 1\Comment{Cardinality of all houses visited by all elves is cardinality of H}\\
5. $\sum_{e \in E} x_e$$_h$ = 1 $\forall$ h$\in$H\Comment{Each house has to be visited from exactly one elf, once}\\
\textbf{Relaxed LP Formulation:}\\
min L\\
s.t.\\
1. $x_e$$_h$ $\geq 0$ $\forall$ e$\in$E,$\forall$ h$\in$H\\
2. $\sum_{h}x_e$$_h$ $\leq$ L $\forall$ e$\in$E\\
3. $|$$\bigcup_{e \in E}$ $\bigcup_{h \in H_e}$ $x_e$$_h$$|$ = $|$H$|$, $x_e$$_h$ $>$ 0\\
4. $\bigcap_{e \in E}$$\bigcup_{h \in H_e} x_e$$_h$ = 0, $x_e$$_h$ $>$ 0\\

\section{Exercise 2.}
Building all the sleighs is a non-deterministic problem, because the only way to proceed is to try all possible combination of pieces until all the sleighs are built and different between each other. This resolution is practicable in polynomial time only if there is a certifier for the problem. So the problem belongs to NP.
For the construction of the sleighs, it is possible to reduce the problem to a Boolean satisfiabilty formulation (SAT). SAT is a NP-complete problem based on propositional logic. Given a CNF (Conjunctive Normal Form) formula, the problem is solved if there exists a variable assignment which returns true.\\
In order to satisfy all Santa's constraints, we need to concatenate several boolean clauses (with AND,OR,NOT operators) which guarantee the correctness and uniqueness of every sleigh. 
Since Santa has a set P of n pieces,by assuming that there are lot of duplicates of each piece, we can choose l$<$n boolean variables which define all different pieces p$\in$P (excluding dupes).\\For each sleigh i, a variable X$_{pk}$ is set to 1 if piece p of category K is used in the costruction of sleigh i, and 0 otherwise and clauses are set in the following way:\\
1. For each category (i.e. bells,frontlight,seat) it can be used at most one piece:
X$_{pk}$$\wedge$$\neg$(X$_{1k}$$\vee...\vee X_{(p-1)k} \vee X_{(p+1)k} \vee....\vee X_{kk}$), k is the number of different elements of category K;\\
2. There must exist at least one piece of color c: all pieces of color c are in $\vee$ between each other
3. Some pieces must be necessarily matched with some other pieces;\\
4. Some pieces are not consistent together with some other pieces;\\
5. There must exist at least j pieces with a specific characteristic
6. There must exist at most j pieces with a specific characteristic

Given the hint, the graph which represent the game G is the following:\\
\begin{tikzpicture}[node distance={35mm},thick,main/.style = {draw, circle}] 
\node[main] (1) {$X_1$}; 
\node[main] (2) [right of=1] {$X_2$};
\node[main] (3) [below of=1] {$X_3$};
\node[main] (4) [below of=2] {$X_4$};
\draw (1) to (2);
\draw (2) to (3);
\draw (3) to (4);
\draw (1) to (4);
\end{tikzpicture}

Price of Anarchy is the quantity: $\frac{max_{s \in S} \sum_{i\in N} u_i(s)}{min_{s \in E} \sum_{i\in N} u_i(s)}$.\\
The set of equilibria for the minimum denominator is given by the following CUT($\alpha$): $X_1\gets$ $\{$LEFT$\}$, $X_2\gets$ $\{$LEFT$\}$,$X_3\gets$ $\{$RIGHT$\}$, $X_4\gets$ $\{$RIGHT$\}$.\\
Total payoff of CUT($\alpha$):  U($\alpha$) $\gets$ $\sum_{i \in N} $$\sum_{e \in CUT(\alpha)\cap N_i}{\omega_e}$ = 4.\\
The set of equilibria for the maximum numerator is given by the following CUT($\alpha$): $X_1\gets$ $\{$LEFT$\}$, $X_2\gets$ $\{$RIGHT$\}$,$X_3\gets$ $\{$LEFT$\}$, $X_4\gets$ $\{$RIGHT$\}$.\\
Total payoff of CUT($\alpha$):  U($\alpha$) $\gets$ $\sum_{i \in N} $$\sum_{e \in CUT(\alpha)\cap N_i}{\omega_e}$ = 8.\\
So the Price of Anarchy of game G is PoA(G) = $\frac{8}{4}$ = 2.
