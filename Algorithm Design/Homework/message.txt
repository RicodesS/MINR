The problem of the construction of 187 different sleighs is a hard one, and in general it's not solvable in a day. A way to show it consists in proving that it's at least as hard as a well-known hard problem.\\
A Boolean satisfiability formulation, or SAT, is the problem of determing if, given a CNF formula $\Phi$, exists a satisfying assignment which returns true. SAT is NP-complete because it's both NP and NP-hard.\\
By reducing the SAT problem to the 187-sleighs problem, we can prove that our problem is at least as hard as SAT, hence an eventual poly-time solution for the sleighs problem would be suitable for SAT too.\\
Our problem takes in input n different pieces (each of them with lots of duplicates) and Santa's constraints, therefore we need to build a SAT formulation which can be transformed into 187-different-sleighs formulation in polynomial time.\\
For the construction of the first sleigh we can consider a SAT problem composed by the following clauses (all related by an AND operator):\\
1) An inclusive OR between all n pieces:($X_1 \vee X_2 \vee .... \vee X_n$)\\
2,3,..,m) The use of AND,OR,NOT operators for combinations of pieces in order to describe Santa's constraints.\\
For the construction of the second sleigh, we can use the same formulation used in the previous case, plus we have to introduce the uniqueness constraint. Given a feasible combination for the first sleigh, to ensure that the next one is different, we have to include in the SAT formulation the clause: $\wedge \neg (X_i \wedge .... \wedge X_j)$, with ($X_i,...,X_j$) the pieces of the previous sleigh.\\
By going with this method, for every k-th sleigh, we have to formulate a SAT consisting of 1) and 2) to m) clauses about sleigh validation, plus k-1 clauses about uniqueness constraint.\\
In this way, the construction of the last sleigh will be represented by a SAT formulation composed by the first usual m clauses plus 186 uniqueness constraints, each of them generated by a previous SAT formulation.\\
On that basis we can finally prove that the 187-sleighs is a really hard problem, and if there exists a polynomial time algorithm that solves this one, that algorithm would solve the SAT problem too.\\
