          <h1>1) </h1><div><div>REST Web service is an architectural-style for developing web services that emphasizes WWW as an open and standard application.</div></div><div>Since Web became more and more famous and used, Firewalls have started to let port 80 always open to permit a secure and easy communication and exchanging of messages between Clients and Web.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>A famous metaphor is the one that defines:</div><div>URI ~ : nouns</div><div>GET/POST etc. : verbs, so action to perform.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>REST is the perfect example of use of API (interfaces provided by servers and discoverable by requestors).</div><div>REST uses HTTP (a standard communication protocol for communication over the web) as standard for communications and uses also its error codes, such as 404 for page not found.</div><div>The use that a REST Web service does of HTTP signs its "Maturity", in fact there are 4 level of maturity of &nbsp;REST:</div><div>0 - HTTP as a tunnel</div><div>1 - Resources</div><div>2 - self-describing messages</div><div>3 - Hypermedia</div><div><br></div><div>So a Web service is called "RESTful" only if it has a maturity level of 3 i.e. uses hypermedia embedded documents in exchanging messages.</div><div><br></div><div>REST has also some design constraints e.g. uniform interface or stateleness interaction, that is also a disadvantage of REST togheter with the too much dependence with HTTP.</div><div>The advantages are: World-wide popularity, firewall friendleness and simplicity.</div><div><br></div><h1>2)</h1><div>SCRUM is an agile processes used in IT &amp; not-IT companies, its principal objective is to produce the most amount of business possible, reducing the time of release</div><div>It interfaces with the relay race: now we concentrate most on how to release sw in less time, instead of concentrate on the reliability and flexibility of the software.</div><div>The SCRUM process wants some steps:</div><div>Product backlog - Sprint backlog - Sprint - Daily scrum - End (Runnable SW)</div><div>Every of these steps are described in the SCRUM Framwork divided in: Roles, activities and artifacts.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>SCRUM Roles:</strong></div><div><strong><em>Product Owner</em>:</strong> "The person that invests in the project", he has to decide what will be the input and output of the project, he set the requirements and the goals, and also the release date and if to accept or reject the work.</div><div><em><strong>ScrumMaster</strong></em><strong>:&nbsp;</strong>Is the guy "expert" of SCRUM , he has to follow the sw processes to ensure that the team is following the SCRUM principles; he has also to shield the team from the external attacks.</div><div><strong><em>Team:</em></strong> Is composed by 5-7 people, the components have to be self-managed and cross-functional<strong>.&nbsp;</strong>The composition of the team cannot change during a sprint.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>SCRUM Activities:</strong></div><div><strong><em>Sprint planning:&nbsp;</em></strong>Now we have to decide which goal we want to implement during the sprint, re-prioritising the ones not completed, and decide how to continue.</div><div><strong><em>Sprint:&nbsp;</em></strong>is a period of 2-4 weeks in which the team develop the stories<strong><em>&nbsp;</em></strong>decided<strong><em><br></em></strong></div><div><strong><em>Daily Scrum:&nbsp;</em></strong>is an activity that the team has to do every day to discuss about the project.<strong><em><br></em></strong></div><div><br></div><div><strong><em><strong><em>SCRUM Artefacts:<br></em></strong></em></strong></div><div><strong><em><strong><em>Product backlog:&nbsp;</em></strong></em></strong>In this phase requirements of the project have to be decided and prioritised.</div><div><strong><em><strong>Sprint backlog</strong><strong>:&nbsp;</strong></em></strong>We have to decide how to continue, look at the stories not finished and re-prioritise them.<strong><em><strong><br></strong></em></strong></div><div><strong><em><strong><em><strong><em>Sprint review:</em></strong>&nbsp;</em></strong></em></strong>Finished the sprint, we have to review the sprint, so talk with the all team and managers about the sprint.<strong><em><strong><em><br></em></strong></em></strong></div><div><strong><em><strong><em><strong><em>Sprint retrospective:&nbsp;</em></strong></em></strong></em></strong>Before&nbsp;starting a new sprint we have to look at what we have done until now and decide if continue or stop.</div><div><br></div><h1><em>3)</em></h1><div>"We cannot govern what we cannot measure" cit.</div><div>To evaluate an estimation in terms of time and effort in a software development process we use Function Point.</div><div>At the base of this method there is a dimension metric: LOC or SLOC (Standard LOC), that indicates the number of lines of code estimated for a project, it can be seem an easy way of evaluaton, but it involve so many parameters, such as the programming language, the technologies, paradigms etc.</div><div><br></div><div>Funciton points uses 5 types of functionalities to separate the requirements:</div><div><strong><em>IL</em></strong><strong><em>F:&nbsp;</em></strong>indicates functionalities that use internal stored data<strong><em><br></em></strong></div><div><em><strong>EIF:&nbsp;</strong></em>indicates functionalities that use external stored data<em><strong>&nbsp;</strong></em>(an EIF is an ILF for another app)<em><strong><br></strong></em></div><div><em><strong>EI:&nbsp;</strong></em>Data retrieved from an input<em><strong><br></strong></em></div><div><em><strong>EO:&nbsp;</strong></em>Data printed to show to an interface<em><strong><br></strong></em></div><div><strong><em>EQ:</em></strong> Data asked but not computed</div><div><br></div><div>ILF and EIF compose the Data Funcionalities</div><div>EI, EO, EQ compose Transactions</div><div><br></div><div>In data functionalities are also computed DET (single-field user data) and RET (multiple-field user data)</div><div>In transacion are computed DET and FTR (entities involved in the transaction)</div><div><br></div><div>How we use FP?</div><div>We have to calculate how much DET, RET and FTR are involved in our functionalities and then sum all togheter.</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; FP = Sum of before + (0.65 * 0.01 + Î£ fi)</div><div><br></div><div>CoCoMo is the achronym of Constructive Most Model, it is a tool to estimate time and effort using these formulas:</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; T = aS<sup>b&nbsp;</sup>&nbsp; &nbsp;&amp; &nbsp;M = cT<sup>d</sup></div><div>a,b,c,d are constants given by a table that change based on the difficulty of the project: from easy to difficult.&nbsp;</div><div>It uses also project parameters that indicates the type of project we are going to develop in terms of language, technologies and soon.</div><div>e.g for an easy project we use:</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; T = 2.4S<sup>1.05</sup> &amp; M = 2.5S<sup>0.38</sup></div><div><sup></sup><br></div><div>CoCoMo II is the obvious evolution of CoCoMo driven by new sw life-cycles and more complex projects.</div><div>The new version is much more accurate, in fact it uses some Scale Factors and Effort multipliers to adapt the calculus of effort and time.</div><div>These parameters are different between the two CoCoMo II models:</div><div>- Early design (is an estimation done before start):</div><div><br></div><div>Precedentness: indicates how much the team know about these things</div><div>Flexibility: flexibility of the project (rigurous --&gt; felixible)</div><div>Resolution: Precision of goals</div><div>Team Cohesion: how much the team can communicate between themselves</div><div>Process Maturity: how much the dev process in mature</div><div><br></div><div>- Post architectural model (use to estimates the maintenance and monitor):</div><div>Product</div><div>System</div><div>Personal</div><div><br></div><div>There is a difference of 7 vs. 17 paramters used between the 2 models.</div><div><br></div><div>CoCoMo II also give indications about SW Reuse.</div><div>The SW Reuse is one of the basic concept of today SW development: it is the perfect example for Legacy systems (System used for a purpose different from the one they were developed for); nowadays there is no reason &nbsp;for develop a system from scratches (also the fundamental of 1-tier architectures), so we have to adapt the code &nbsp;to our purposes, and for doing it, there are some parameters that help us calculating the effort needed to interpolate that code:&nbsp;</div><div>SW Understanding: how much we understand about that project</div><div>Assessment &amp; assimilation: how we will use it on our project</div><div>% of modification on the code: how much we are going to change on the code.</div><div><br></div><div><strong><em><strong><em><strong><br></strong></em></strong></em></strong></div><h1><strong><em><strong><em><strong>Rest Solution<br></strong></em></strong></em></strong></h1><h1><img src="https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/exam-net.appspot.com/o/production%2Fexams%2F15CB9DDF-FECE-4FAF-9B97-87844BA53973%2Fstudents%2F8281162%2FUbdJnzMv0vlxP01KCiSK.jpg?alt=media&amp;token=09b2ec13-9bf2-439b-bdd8-6b545d65c555" style="display: block;
